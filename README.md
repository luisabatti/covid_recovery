# Analyzing the Rebound of the Canadian Economy Post-COVID



## Objectives
This data analysis project provides a comprehensive exploration of the Canadian economy's recovery following the COVID-19 pandemic, from the initial impact in Q2 2020 through to Q2 2023. Utilizing an extensive dataset that encompasses a variety of industries, the analysis investigates the fluctuating economic health of each sector, highlighting areas of growth and decline.

Key areas of focus include the identification of industries that experienced the best and worst growth rates between Q2 2019 and Q2 2023. The study further compares these figures to performance metrics during the first wave of the pandemic in Q2 2020, providing a nuanced understanding of industry resilience and adaptability in the face of unprecedented challenges.

Furthermore, the project provides insights into the recovery journey of the industries that were most profoundly affected during the initial stages of the pandemic. Through an in-depth investigation of these sectors, this project seeks to evaluate whether they have been able to regain their footing and adapt to the 'new normal' precipitated by the COVID-19 crisis.

This portfolio project offers valuable insights for individuals looking to understand the economic ramifications of the COVID-19 pandemic, providing a thorough and detailed analysis of recovery trends across the diverse landscape of Canadian industries.
